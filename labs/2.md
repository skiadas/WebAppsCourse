# Lab 2

In this lab you will learn how to write tests, and practice some of the structure-building concepts we have learned so far.

## Testing Basics



## Testing in Javascript

We will be using [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) in combination with [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for our tests. Here is a basic html file:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="mocha.css" />
</head>
<body>
   <div id="mocha"></div>
   <script src="chai.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   <script src="mocha.js"></script>
   <script>
      mocha.setup('bdd');
      var expect = chai.expect;
   </script>
   <script src="yourCode.js"></script>
   <script src="tests.spec.js"></script>
   <script>
      mocha.checkLeaks();
      mocha.globals(['chai']);
      mocha.run();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

All the tests go into `tests.spec.js` (or a similarly named file). You can also use multiple test files, just put them after each other.

## Basic steps

1. You should have already decided which of the two partner's GitHub account to use.
2. If you have not switched roles with your partner so far, this is a good time to do so.
3. Check out the correct branch, via `git checkout Lab2`.
4. Open the `README.md` file there, it will contain the instructions on what you need to do.
5. Commit your changes, review them, push them to your repository, and when you are ready to submit simply email me a link to your project and the SHA of the commit that contains your final submission.
6. You should use the issues page to track your progress. Create a new label called "Lab2" and use it to tag all issues related to this lab. I will review those issues to look at your work.
7. Needless to say it ,but you are NOT allowed to look at other people's forks of the project and their issues/solutions.
8. I expect you to do the coding using pair programming.
