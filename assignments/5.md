5. Consider the following code:

```javascript
var A = [], B = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
    A[i] = function() {  return i; };
    B[i] = (function(i) {
                return function() { return i; };
            })(i);
}
A.forEach(function(f, ind) { console.log("A", ind, f()); });
B.forEach(function(f, ind) { console.log("B", ind, f()); });
```

Describe the output produced by this code, and explain the unusual behavior (You should make sure you run this code in the console).
