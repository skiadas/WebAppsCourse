<h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>The main objective of the course is to familiarize students with the multiple facets of developing a web application.</p>
<ul>
<li>General Development Practices
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: You will learn the importance of writing extensive and appropriate test suites for your code, and will become familiar with Test-Driven Development. Technologies involved: Mocha, Chai</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: You will learn how to document your code and in general practice writing documentation for your projects. Technologies involved: JSDoc, Markdown</li>
<li><strong>Modularization</strong>: You will learn how to decompose your code into modular units that can act independent of each other, and various methodologies for combining them to form bigger projects.</li>
<li><strong>Pair programming</strong>: You will practice Pair Programming, where two programmers work on the same computer at the same time, learning from each other as they go along.</li>
<li><strong>Version Control</strong>: You will learn how to use revision control software and websites to manage your code, track unresolved issues, and share with others. Relevant technologies: Git, GitHub</li>
<li><strong>Design Patterns</strong>: You will learn about a number of standard design patterns useful in web applications, as well as various techniques for asynchronous and evented programming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Specific Programming Objectives
<ul>
<li><strong>Javascript</strong>: The main programming language on the web. We will spend a large part of the course learning to work with Javascript.
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Javascript</strong>: Fundamental structures and functions provided by the language.</li>
<li><strong>DOM</strong>: The browser extensions that provide web-page interactivity.</li>
<li><strong>Node</strong>: Server-side scripting extension to Javascript.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong>: Used for designing the page. We will spend a very limited amount of time on this.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP/XmlHttpRequest</strong>: The protocols that allow the web page to interact with the rest of the world. We will spend a little bit of time on this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
