<h3 id="general-information-about-version-control-and-git">General information about Version Control and git</h3>
<ul>
<li>Version Control allows you to maintain copies of your code at various stages during its evolution.</li>
<li>Here are some things it allows you to do:
<ul>
<li>quickly revert back to a previous, perhaps more stable, version of your code</li>
<li>see the differences between where you code is now and where it was at a previous time</li>
<li>find out who in your team was the last person to change a line of code, and what happened in that change</li>
<li>seamlessly merge together changes implemented at the same time by different people</li>
<li>share changes to someone's code, that they can decide to use or not</li>
<li>see a history of what has happened when in your code</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your code history is stored in a <strong>repository</strong></li>
<li>A specific version of your code is called a <strong>revision</strong></li>
<li>Creating a new revision based on the current state of your code is called a <strong>commit</strong></li>
<li>We will be using &quot;git&quot;, which is known as a <strong>distributed version control system</strong>
<ul>
<li>Essentially this means that each person holds in their local repository the entire history of the project</li>
<li>Git achieves this very efficiently</li>
<li>Git was developed in order to maintain the Linux operating system kernel</li>
<li>DVCSs allow nonlinear development. You can work on your computer moving along and making commits, and at some later point try to sync those commits with a backup repository that others may have been using as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you commit, git takes a &quot;snapshot&quot; of how your entire project filesystem looks, and saves that snapshot.</li>
<li>Git uses a lot of checksums. Every file and snapshot is captured by its checksum and referred to that way.</li>
<li><p>When working with Git there are 3 main areas (see <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics#The-Three-States">here</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dt>repository</dt>
<dd>where all previous revisions are stored. This is actually a hidden folder named &quot;.git&quot;, and nothing more.
</dd>
<dt>working directory</dt>
<dd>This is your current directory the way you have it set up, with all its files and things.
</dd>
<dt>staging area</dt>
<dd>This sits between the repository and the working directory. When you decide that you want to keep some of the changes you made to your repository, you will &quot;stage&quot; them, and then they become part of the staging area. When you are certain that you have staged all the changes that &quot;are logically together&quot;, you can &quot;commit&quot; them, which moves these staged changes into the repository.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>Your files can be in 4 <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">different states</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>committed</dt>
<dd>these are files whose current version is already in the repository.
</dd>
<dt>staged</dt>
<dd>these files have some modifications to them, and we have already added them to the staging area.
</dd>
<dt>modified</dt>
<dd>these files have some modifications to them, but have not been added to the staging area.
</dd>
<dt>untracked</dt>
<dd>these files are in the directory that is being tracked by the repository, but they themselves have never been added to the repository.
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-git-in-your-system">Setting up git in your system</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have already installed git for you. You do need to customize it a bit however.</li>
<li><p>First, you want to set a name and email address for yourself. These are used every time you make a commit, to identify who made the commit. You can do this with the lines:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name &quot;John Doe&quot;
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Next you will want to set your editor, so that git knows what program to use. This would be done with a line like:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global core.editor &quot;/usr/bin/subl -n -w&quot;</code></pre>
of course the path will be different depending on what editor you want to use; the above line is for sublime text. For vi you would do instead <code>&quot;/usr/bin/vi&quot;</code>, for emacs you would do <code>&quot;/usr/bin/emacs&quot;</code></li>
<li><p>You can verify your settings with <code>git config --list</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
