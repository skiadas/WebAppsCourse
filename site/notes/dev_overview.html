<h3 id="overview-of-software-development-practices-1">Overview of Software Development Practices</h3>
<p>Writing new code to perform some task is but a small, albeit important, part of being a software developer. But a considerable part of your work involves other tasks. The key common element in all of these is effectively that a managing a large code base:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software development practices need to consider a reality of tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code to be managed over many years by multiple programmers, along with an ever-changing set of requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a brief listing of some common needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide the program requirements.</li>
<li>Keep track of progress towards meeting the requirements.</li>
<li>Review other people’s code.</li>
<li>Have others review your code.</li>
<li>Add new features without breaking existing features.</li>
<li>Manage listing and priority of fixing for existing problems.</li>
<li>Rework existing code without breaking functionality.</li>
<li>Incorporate your code changes into a larger codebase, without conflicts with other people’s changes.</li>
<li>Review and incorporate someone else’s code contributions into your code base.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of common practices have been developed in response to these needs:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Modularity</dt>
<dd>Designing an application as a set of loosely couple modules, each with its own clear requirements and interactions.
</dd>
<dt>Testing</dt>
<dd><em>Unit tests</em> that test single functions in the code, as well as <em>functional/integration tests</em> that test overall behavior and module interaction. These offer a certain degree of reliability when changing code: If you break something, your tests will tell you about it (usually).
</dd>
<dt>Version Control</dt>
<dd>Version control allows you to see the evolution of code over time: Who committed what and when, and how that differs from before.
</dd>
<dt>Issue/Bug Tracking</dt>
<dd>There should be a simple mechanism for identifying issues that need to be addressed, documenting a discussion of those issues, setting up priorities and assignments.
</dd>
<dt>Coding Standards</dt>
<dd>It is important that everyone follows a common and clear coding standard. When reviewing someone’s code, it is hard enough to try to understand what they are trying to do without getting distracted by the lack of a semicolon or some weird spacing between terms, or a bizarre control flow structure.
</dd>
<dt>Documentation</dt>
<dd>When a project involves many constituents and a long passage of time, proper documentation is crucial. This occurs at various levels: user manuals, function and module documentations that turn into developer docs, and inline comments on complex code parts are all important components of a large project.
</dd>
<dt>Pair Programming</dt>
<dd>Working with another programmer at your side as you consider each line of code prevents errors early on, and helps programmers learn from each other and establish common patterns.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We will try to touch on all those in this class, both during the labs and as you work on your term project. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/Hanover-CS/Comps_Documents/blob/master/development_rubric.html">this rubric</a> will be used to evaluate your project (and your senior projects when you get to them).</p>
