<h1 id="lab-2">Lab 2<span class="small"> (<a href="2.pdf" title="2">pdf</a>)</span></h1>
<p>In this lab you will learn how to write tests, and practice some of the structure-building concepts we have learned so far.</p>
<h2 id="testing-basics">Testing Basics</h2>
<p>When we refer to tests, we typically mean automated tests. Those tests fall into various categories:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Unit Tests</dt>
<dd><p>Unit tests test a single tiny individual component of your application. You typically want to have unit tests for every bit of your code that is part of your application's <em>interface</em>.</p>
<p>You should avoid testing for things that are too implementation-dependent.</p>
<p>Unit tests are a crucial part of the refactoring process, whose goal is to rearrange and rewrite sections of your code. A solid suite of unit tests can allow you to do this freely without worrying about breaking code. &quot;Your tests will catch that&quot;. And revision control allows you to recover if you've messed things up too much.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Integration Tests</dt>
<dd><p>Integration tests test bigger parts of your application, making sure that different parts come together naturally.</p>
<p>Time permitting, we will talk more about integration tests later in the term.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Timing Tests</dt>
<dd><p>Timing tests are used in algorithm implementations to assess the efficiency of the algorithms.</p>
<p>They can also be used to try to find bottlenecks in your application, though some of the browser profiling tools might be better.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deployment Tests</dt>
<dd>Deployment tests are meant to ensure that your application performs well on various browsers / deployment environments. Hard to do.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We will focus on unit tests for now.</p>
<h2 id="test-driven-development">Test-Driven Development</h2>
<p>In Test-Driven-Development, you typically would follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on a small piece of functionality you want to add.</li>
<li>Make a GitHub issue about it.
<ul>
<li>If you prefer, you can create one bigger more &quot;logical&quot; issue, and create a &quot;task list&quot; in it, following the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments">example at this blog post</a>. Then check those items off as you implement them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a test for the code you want to introduce.</li>
<li>Run your tests, and watch this new test fail. This makes us more certain that the test does indeed detect the feature we want to add.</li>
<li>Optionally, make a git commit of the test, using &quot;#...&quot; to reference the issue you created.
<ul>
<li>This is a bit of a style decision, whether to commit the tests separately or whether to do one commit containing both test and new code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a minimal set of code that would make the test pass.</li>
<li>Check that all your tests pass.</li>
<li>Make a commit, using &quot;#...&quot; to reference the issue you created. Say &quot;close #...&quot; if it was a &quot;single-problem issue&quot;.
<ul>
<li>This gives you a safe backup point to revert to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider any refactoring that you might want to have take place.</li>
<li>Do the refactoring, and make sure your tests still all pass.</li>
<li>Commit (optionally creating an issue first to explain what the refactoring was about).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is some of the general theory behind testing. The lab readme will have more specific instructions.</p>
<h2 id="testing-in-javascript">Testing in Javascript</h2>
<p>We will be using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mocha</a> in combination with <a href="http://chaijs.com/">chai</a> for our unit tests. Here is a basic html file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;!DOCTYPE </span>html<span class="dt">&gt;</span>

&lt;<span class="ot">/body&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">&lt;/html</span>&gt;</code></pre>
<p>All the tests go into <code>tests.spec.js</code> (or a similarly named file). You can also use multiple test files, just put them after each other. Use the rest as a template on every project.</p>
<p>mocha and chai together offer all the primitives we need for testing. We will describe them briefly in the following section. Refer to their homepages for more info.</p>
<h3 id="mocha-and-chai">Mocha and Chai</h3>
<p>Mocha provides a couple of basic functions for us. We use them to structure our test suites.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>describe</code></dt>
<dd><p>Starts a new test suite. First argument is a string &quot;title&quot;. Second is an anonymous argumentless function that contains the tests.</p>
<p>The string titles together with the titles from the &quot;it&quot; sections should form sentences asserting what the test does.</p>
<p>You can have nested &quot;describe&quot;s.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>it</code></dt>
<dd><p>Starts a new unit test. Should only appear within the function in a &quot;describe&quot;. First argument is a string &quot;test title&quot;. Together with the &quot;describe&quot;'s string, it should form a sentence.</p>
<p>Second argument is an anonymous argumentless function. It will contain the statements that comprise the test.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>before</code>/<code>after</code></dt>
<dd>They go in a &quot;describe&quot; and they take as argument an anonymous argumentless function. They will run this function before starting (respectively after completing) the tests. Look for &quot;hooks&quot; in mocha doc.
</dd>
<dt><code>beforeEach</code>/<code>afterEach</code></dt>
<dd>Similar, except that they run before/after <em>each</em> test in the describe, rather than only once. Look for &quot;hooks&quot; in mocha doc.
</dd>
<dt><code>only</code></dt>
<dd>You can force the running of a single test, or test suite, by using this. Look for &quot;exclusive tests&quot; in mocha doc.
</dd>
<dt><code>skip</code></dt>
<dd>Can be used to tell it to skip the specific test. Look for &quot;inclusive tests&quot; in mocha doc.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Chai is used to write tests. We will be using its &quot;expect&quot; interface, <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/">whose API is here</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>expect(...)</code></dt>
<dd>The start point. <code>expect(something).to..</code> is the basic structure. Everything else is &quot;chained&quot; at the end of the expect.
</dd>
<dt>chainable words</dt>
<dd>a series of &quot;words&quot; that have no meaning but are used to form something that looks more like a sentence: &quot;to&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, some more.
</dd>
<dt><code>.not</code></dt>
<dd>negates the test.
</dd>
<dt><code>.deep</code></dt>
<dd>for array comparisons, it will test each matching element. So two arrays would be equal if they have equal elements, even if they are different objects.
</dd>
<dt><code>.a(...)</code></dt>
<dd>checks for <code>typeof</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>.include(...)</code></dt>
<dd>checks that target includes the value.
</dd>
<dt><code>.equal(...)</code></dt>
<dd>tests that the target equals the value.
</dd>
<dt>many others</dt>
<dd>Look in the <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/">Chai API</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="basic-steps">Basic steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You should have already decided which of the two partner's GitHub account to use.</li>
<li>If you have not switched roles with your partner so far, this is a good time to do so.</li>
<li>You need to first bring your version of the lab up-to-date by fetching from the remote that is linked to MY project. This is a bit tedious.
<ul>
<li>Use &quot;<code>git remote -v</code>&quot; to see the remote branches. There should be one named <code>mainSource</code> and pointing to <code>skiadas/WebAppsLabs</code>.</li>
<li>We will start by fetching the newest version of that, with: &quot;<code>git fetch mainSource</code>&quot;. It should tell you about a new branch, Lab2.</li>
<li>Create a new branch with &quot;<code>git checkout -b Lab2 --track mainSource/Lab2</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Push this repository to your fork, by &quot;<code>git push origin Lab2</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Set your local branch to in the future update your repository by: &quot;<code>git branch --set-upstream Lab2 origin/Lab2</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>To make sure this is set up properly, do &quot;<code>git branch -vv</code>&quot;. You should see <code>[origin/Lab2]</code> next to the Lab2 branch line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check out the correct branch, via <code>git checkout Lab2</code>.</li>
<li>Open the <code>README.md</code> file there, it will contain the instructions on what you need to do.</li>
<li>When you are ready to submit simply email me a link to your project and the SHA of the commit that contains your final submission.</li>
<li>You should use the issues page to track your progress. Create a new label called &quot;Lab2&quot; and use it to tag all issues related to this lab. I will review those issues to look at your work.</li>
<li>Needless to say it, but you are NOT allowed to look at other people's forks of the project and their issues/solutions.</li>
<li>I expect you to do the coding using pair programming.</li>
