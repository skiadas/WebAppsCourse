<h1 id="lab-2">Lab 2<span class="small"> (<a href="2.pdf" title="2">pdf</a>)</span></h1>
<p>In this lab you will learn how to write tests, and practice some of the structure-building concepts we have learned so far.</p>
<h2 id="testing-basics">Testing Basics</h2>
<p>When we refer to tests, we typically mean automated tests. Those tests fall into various categories:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Unit Tests</dt>
<dd><p>Unit tests test a single tiny individual component of your application. You typically want to have unit tests for every bit of your code that is part of your application's <em>interface</em>.</p>
<p>You should avoid testing for things that are too implementation-dependent.</p>
<p>Unit tests are a crucial part of the refactoring process, whose goal is to rearrange and rewrite sections of your code. A solid suite of unit tests can allow you to do this freely without worrying about breaking code. &quot;Your tests will catch that&quot;. And revision control allows you to recover if you've messed things up too much.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Integration Tests</dt>
<dd><p>Integration tests test bigger parts of your application, making sure that different parts come together naturally.</p>
<p>Time permitting, we will talk more about integration tests later in the term.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Timing Tests</dt>
<dd><p>Timing tests are used in algorithm implementations to assess the efficiency of the algorithms.</p>
<p>They can also be used to try to find bottlenecks in your application, though some of the browser profiling tools might be better.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Deployment Tests</dt>
<dd>Deployment tests are meant to ensure that your application performs well on various browsers / deployment environments. Hard to do.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We will focus on unit tests for now.</p>
<h2 id="test-driven-development">Test-Driven Development</h2>
<p>In Test-Driven-Development, you typically would follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on a small piece of functionality you want to add.</li>
<li>Make a GitHub issue about it.
<ul>
<li>If you prefer, you can create one bigger more &quot;logical&quot; issue, and create a &quot;task list&quot; in it, following the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments">example at this blog post</a>. Then check those items off as you implement them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a test for the code you want to introduce.</li>
<li>Run your tests, and watch this new test fail. This makes us more certain that the test does indeed detect the feature we want to add.</li>
<li>Optionally, make a git commit of the test, using &quot;#...&quot; to reference the issue you created.
<ul>
<li>This is a bit of a style decision, whether to commit the tests separately or whether to do one commit containing both test and new code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a minimal set of code that would make the test pass.</li>
<li>Check that all your tests pass.</li>
<li>Make a commit, using &quot;#...&quot; to reference the issue you created. Say &quot;close #...&quot; if it was a &quot;single-problem issue&quot;.
<ul>
<li>This gives you a safe backup point to revert to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider any refactoring that you might want to have take place.</li>
<li>Do the refactoring, and make sure your tests still all pass.</li>
<li>Commit (optionally creating an issue first to explain what the refactoring was about).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is some of the general theory behind testing. The lab readme will have more specific instructions.</p>
<h2 id="testing-in-javascript">Testing in Javascript</h2>
<p>We will be using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mocha</a> in combination with <a href="http://chaijs.com/">chai</a> for our unit tests. Here is a basic html file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;link rel=<span class="st">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> href=<span class="st">&quot;mocha.css&quot;</span> <span class="ot">/&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">&lt;/head</span>&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;div id=<span class="st">&quot;mocha&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="ot">/div&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">   &lt;script src=&quot;chai.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript</span><span class="st">&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
   &lt;script src=<span class="st">&quot;mocha.js&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="ot">/script&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">   &lt;script&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">      mocha.setup</span><span class="fl">(</span><span class="ot">&#39;bdd&#39;</span><span class="fl">)</span><span class="ot">;</span>
<span class="ot">      var expect = chai.expect;</span>
<span class="ot">   &lt;/script</span>&gt;
   &lt;script src=<span class="st">&quot;yourCode.js&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="ot">/script&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">   &lt;script src=&quot;tests.spec.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script</span>&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
      <span class="ot">mocha</span>.<span class="fu">checkLeaks</span>();
      <span class="ot">mocha</span>.<span class="fu">globals</span>([<span class="st">&#39;chai&#39;</span>]);
      <span class="ot">mocha</span>.<span class="fu">run</span>();
  &lt;<span class="ot">/script&gt;</span>
<span class="ot">&lt;/body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="ot">/html&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>All the tests go into <code>tests.spec.js</code> (or a similarly named file). You can also use multiple test files, just put them after each other. Use the rest as a template on every project.</p>
<h2 id="basic-steps">Basic steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You should have already decided which of the two partner's GitHub account to use.</li>
<li>If you have not switched roles with your partner so far, this is a good time to do so.</li>
<li>Check out the correct branch, via <code>git checkout Lab2</code>.</li>
<li>Open the <code>README.md</code> file there, it will contain the instructions on what you need to do.</li>
<li>Commit your changes, review them, push them to your repository, and when you are ready to submit simply email me a link to your project and the SHA of the commit that contains your final submission.</li>
<li>You should use the issues page to track your progress. Create a new label called &quot;Lab2&quot; and use it to tag all issues related to this lab. I will review those issues to look at your work.</li>
<li>Needless to say it ,but you are NOT allowed to look at other people's forks of the project and their issues/solutions.</li>
<li>I expect you to do the coding using pair programming.</li>
</ol>
