<h1 id="lab-1">Lab 1<span class="small"> (<a href="1.pdf" class="small" title="1">pdf</a>)</span></h1>
<p>In this lab you will learn the basics of working with git and GitHub, and practice some of the material we have learned so far.</p>
<p>You should have already gone through the previous links on working with git and github:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../notes/git_version_control.html">Basics of Version Control</a></li>
<li><a href="../notes/git_basics.html">Git basics</a></li>
<li><a href="../notes/github_basics.html">GitHub basics</a></li>
<li><a href="../notes/git_remotes_branches.html">Remotes and Branches</a></li>
<li><a href="../notes/github_workflow.html">GitHub Workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="../notes/project_workflow.html">Overall Project Workflow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the main steps to follow.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First off, you will work with your partner on this project. So make sure you are together on the same computer, and have decided whose account you will use as the main repository. This account will be the same for all labs. Recall that in the project workflow page we covered that both team members should clone the same person’s project, so the other person in the group will have to delete their WebAppsLabs folder and reclone it based on the first person’s repository, as described in the <a href="../notes/project_workflow.html">project workflow page</a>.</li>
<li>Decide on whose computer you will start work. Then check out the correct branch, via <code>git checkout Lab1</code>.</li>
<li>Open the <code>README.md</code> file there, it will contain the instructions on what you need to do.</li>
<li>Commit your changes, review them, push them to your repository, and when you are ready to submit simply email me a link to your project and the SHA of the commit that contains your final submission.</li>
<li>You should use the issues page to track your progress. Create a new label called “Lab1” and use it to tag all issues related to this lab. I will review those issues to look at your work.</li>
<li>Needless to say it ,but you are NOT allowed to look at other people’s forks of the project and their issues/solutions.</li>
<li>I expect you to do the coding using pair programming.</li>
</ol>
