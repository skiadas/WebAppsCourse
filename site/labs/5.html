<h1 id="lab-5">Lab 5<span class="small"> (<a href="5.pdf" title="5">pdf</a>)</span></h1>
<p>In this lab we will continue our Lab 3 work and create a task collection class.</p>
<p>You should continue to create atomic issues and make atomic commits referencing the issues. I will expect to see a number of issues and corresponding commits to match them.</p>
<h2 id="basic-steps">Basic steps</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You should have already decided which of the two partner's GitHub account to use.</li>
<li>If you have not switched roles with your partner for a while, this is a good time to do so.</li>
<li>You need to first bring your version of the lab up-to-date by fetching from the remote that is linked to MY project. This is a bit tedious. Only ONE of the two persons needs to do this.
<ul>
<li>Use &quot;<code>git remote -v</code>&quot; to see the remote branches. There should be one named <code>mainSource</code> and pointing to <code>skiadas/WebAppsLabs</code>.</li>
<li>We will start by fetching the newest version of that, with: &quot;<code>git fetch mainSource</code>&quot;. It should tell you about a new branch, Lab5.</li>
<li>Create a new branch with &quot;<code>git checkout -b Lab5 --track mainSource/Lab5</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Push this repository to your fork, by &quot;<code>git push origin Lab5</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Set your local branch to in the future update your repository by: &quot;<code>git branch --set-upstream Lab5 origin/Lab5</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>To make sure this is set up properly, do &quot;<code>git branch -vv</code>&quot;. You should see <code>[origin/Lab5]</code> next to the Lab5 branch line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check out the correct branch, via <code>git checkout Lab5</code>.</li>
<li>One person did steps 3 and 4, here is what the other person needs to do after that, on their repository:
<ul>
<li>Use &quot;<code>git fetch origin</code>&quot; to grab the changes your partner just made.</li>
<li>Create a new branch to follow the new lab by &quot;<code>git branch Lab5 origin/Lab5</code>&quot;.</li>
<li>Switch to the new branch via &quot;<code>git checkout Lab5</code>&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the GitHub issues page for your project, switch to the Milestones tab and create a Lab5 milestone. Use that instead of a label for all issues you create related to Lab5.</li>
<li>In the Settings page you can set the &quot;Default branch&quot; for the application. Set this to the Lab5 branch. This should make it so that your pushed commits close any issues that they mention via &quot;Close #n&quot;.</li>
<li>Open the <code>README.md</code> file there, it will contain the instructions on what you need to do.</li>
<li>When you are ready to submit simply email me a link to your project and the SHA of the commit that contains your final submission.</li>
<li>You should use the issues page to track your progress. Use the Lab5 milestone to track the relevant issues. I will review those issues to look at your work.</li>
<li>Needless to say it, but you are NOT allowed to look at other people's forks of the project and their issues/solutions.</li>
<li>I expect you to do the coding using pair programming.</li>
</ol>
