<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>This course focuses on some of the fundamentals of software development, with a distinct emphasis on the development of rich large-scale web applications. Along the way, you will become skilled in Javascript, the programming language for the web.</p>
<p>Large-scale applications contain at a minimum tens of thousands of code lines, and possibly hundreds of thousands. And a lot of that code is interconnected, so changes in one place might have ramifications all over the code base. Most of these projects also last for many years, and involve many revisions of the code, often by different programmers. Managing to work with such large pieces of code requires discipline and consistent use of practices aimed at managing as well as reducing the complexity of your code.</p>
<p>We will cover such practices as:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a version control system to maintain ever-evolving code.</li>
<li>employing extensive test suites to ensure more stable code.</li>
<li>documenting your code so that both your users and future maintainers can use your application.</li>
<li>modularizing your code base into manageable and reusable components.</li>
<li>employing design patterns to create a common frame of reference.</li>
<li>following the Pair Programming discipline which enables programmers to learn from each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all essential skills transferable to other programming languages and environments. We will also be focusing on a number of issues related specifically to Javascript programming and Web Applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core language features and patterns.</li>
<li>Interacting with a web page and a web server.</li>
<li>Handling the asynchronous nature of user interaction and network communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>A large part of the course will be a project that you will be working on in collaboration with one other student. This will give you the opportunity to practice the above principles in a real project, as well as giving you the satisfaction of having created a deliverable project of your own.</p>
<h2 id="course-components">Course Components</h2>
<h3 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h3>
<p>In the <a href="skiadas.github.io/WebAppsCourse/site/schedule.html">class schedule page</a> you will find, for each class day, a list of links to reading assignments. Your homework and lab work will require you to have a solid understanding of the material covered there, so I strongly encourage you not to get behind.</p>
<h3 id="class-attendance">Class Attendance</h3>
<p>You are expected to attend every class meeting, including labs. You are only allowed to miss 3 classes without excuse. From that point on, every unexcused absence will result in a reduction of your final score by one percentage point, up to a total of 5 points. Excused absences should be arranged in advance, and backed by appropriate documentation. Emergencies will be dealt with on an individual basis. There are very few reasons that would qualify as an excuse for an absence.</p>
<h3 id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>You will have homework assignments about twice a week, based on the material covered that week. You are expected to work on these on your own. Whenever there is code involved, make sure to have tested the code in the Console before filling in your answer.</p>
<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>About once a week you will have a slightly longer and more thought-involving lab assignment. You will work on these labs with the same person that will be your collaborator for the project. It is expected that you will work following a pair-programming paradigm, where you both work on the same computer, one person typing and another thinking about the code, trading places ever so often.</p>
<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>
<p>There will be a final exam during exam week, focusing on some of the theoretical aspects of the course. I will provide you more information on what will be covered as we approach the end of the term.</p>
<h3 id="project">Project</h3>
<p>A large part of your grade will be the term project that you will need to work on with one partner. The end result will be a fully-functioning Web Application and the GitHub project used to maintain it. This will also include documentation and an extensive test suite for your application.</p>
<h3 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should never hesitate to ask me questions. I will never think any less of anyone for asking a question. Stop by my office hours or just email me your question, which has the great benefit of forcing you to write it down in clear terms, which often helps you understand it better.</li>
<li>There are lot of online resources that are linked from the reading assignments and the site's links page. You are free and encouraged to use those resources.</li>
<li>You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work together and help each other regarding the notes and understanding the material.</li>
<li>You may discuss the ideas behind the homework problems with others, but only after you have spent some time trying them on your own. The submitted work must be your own! So even though you may talk to others about the problems, when you sit down to write the answers you should be on your own.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade depends on class attendance, homework, labs, project and the final, as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Component</th>
<th align="right">Percent</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Attendance</td>
<td align="right">5%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Homework</td>
<td align="right">10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Labs</td>
<td align="right">25%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">Project</td>
<td align="right">35%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">Final</td>
<td align="right">25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This gives a number up to 100, which is then converted to a letter grade based roughly on the following correspondence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Letter grade</th>
<th align="right">Percentage Range</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">A, A-</td>
<td align="right">90%-100%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">B+, B, B-</td>
<td align="right">80%-90%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">C+, C, C-</td>
<td align="right">70%-80%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">D+, D, D-</td>
<td align="right">60%-70%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">F</td>
<td align="right">0%-60%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
