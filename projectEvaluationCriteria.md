# Project Evaluation Criteria

We will not have an in-class presentation.

Grade will be based entirely on your GitHub project and its final state.

- Documentation
    - Is there a README.md?
        - Does it describe the application's intent?
        - Does it describe how one would use the application?
    - Is there another `.md` document file describing the application's class structure?
        - Does it clearly describe the different components?
        - Does it clearly describe the interactions between those components?
    - Are there comments in each file?
        - One comment near the top describing the file
        - Comments above each key structure/method in the file
        - Do methods clearly describe their inputs and return values?
        - Do methods clearly describe both normal and (if any) unusual behavior?
- Project Management
    - Are there sufficient GitHub issues created and closed for the various parts of the project?
    - Are those issues linked to commits?
    - Do the comments/titles in the issues adequately describe what the problem is and how it will be solved?
    - Are commits sufficiently "atomic"?
    - Do we have sufficient commits from both participants?
- Code
    - Is a `.eslintrc` file in place?
    - Does the project pass `eslint` with no errors/warnings?
    - Are variable names appropriate for the variables they represent?
    - Is the application running properly?
    - Are variable names with capital first letter used only for constructor functions and modules/classes?
    - Is the code properly indented and clear to read?
    - Are there sufficient unit tests for the model and other non-ui elements?
