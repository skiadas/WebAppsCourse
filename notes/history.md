## History of Javascript

- 1993
    - Mosaic Web Browser developed in UIUC. First popular web browser (image tag).
    - Part of that group created Netscape. Another part created Explorer.
- 1995
    - Javascript designed within 2 weeks by Brendan Eich at Netscape. Goal was to add interactivity to web pages.
    - Initially named Mocha, then LiveScript.
    - Influenced by other languages: Self (prototype objects), Scheme (function model), Java (syntax).
    - Was originally meant to also run on the server (LiveWire).
    - Netscape and Sun team up to fight Microsoft.
    - Netscape licensed the name Javascript from Sun (who had trademark on `Java`), to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time. Java was supposed to be the web language back in 1995.
    - Sun/Oracle still holds the trademark on "Javascript".
- 1996
    - Microsoft reverse-engineers "JScript" in 1996 for IE 3 to compete with Netscape. Named so to avoid trademark disputes.
    - Netscape asked W3C to standardize the language. W3C said no.
    - In November 1996 they asked [ECMA](http://www.ecma-international.org/). First standard adopted in June 1997. It is called ECMAScript. (Because noone else was allowed to call it JavaScript).
- Browser wars (1996-1999)
    - Netscape and Microsoft start introducing new and slightly incompatible features
    - Webpage writers want to use these features. Browser detection.
    - As other browsers start supporting features, they need to bypass browser detection.
    - A lot of old code still maintains some of these ugly hacks.
- 1999
    - ECMAScript 3 standard (baseline for modern JS) released.
    - Era of standardization begins.
    - Still many legacy sites out there.
    - Still many users using old browsers.
- 2005
    - Ajax introduced: A set of (existing) technologies that allows web applications to load data in the background.
    - Work on web standardization continues.
- 2009
    - ECMAScript 3.1 renamed to ECMAScript 5. Essentially the current standard.
    - ES5 has "default" and "strict" mode.
    - Node is released. Server-side Javascript.
- 2015 ES6, codenamed Harmony, finalized. It is implemented in all current browsers
    - Many improvements and cleanup
    - Brings classes, and components
    - Many "transpilers" exist that turn ES6 code into ES5 to run on older systems
