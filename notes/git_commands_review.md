[git commit](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)
  ~ Creates a commit from the staged changes. Use the `-m` flag to leave a message right there.

[git diff](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)
  ~ Shows the difference between two versions of a file. Do `git diff --staged` to see the modifications that are staged.
