## Variables in Javascript

- Apart from a few reserved words, most other identifiers can be used as variable names.
- You declare a local variable via the keyword `var`. You can also give it a value at the same time.
- To begin with, things are defined in the global scope. A new scope is created within the body of any function.
- One particularly interesting behavior of Javascript is "variable hoisting": *Variable declarations are always processed as if they happened at the top of the function*.

    For example consider the following code:
    ```
    function f() {
        a = 2;
        var a = 1;
    }
    ```

    This is equivalent to:
    ```
    function f() {
        var a;
        a = 2;
        a = 1;
    }
    ```

- A local variable is not visible outside the scope of the function in which it was defined.
- Variables that are assigned a value without a corresponding declaration are "global". Global variables are visible everywhere.
- Global variables are really nothing more than properties of the global object:
    ```
    a = 2;        // Defining a global variable
    window.a;     // That variable exists as part of the global object
    window.b = 4; // Can define global variables as properties of the global object
    b;            // Returns 4
    ```

    > Note: Very few things in Javascript are protected. For instance this line overwrites the Math object:
    > ```js
    > Math = {}
    > ```
- Here is a gotcha to watch out for, there are no other scopes than those introduced by functions. For example a `for` loop does NOT introduce a new scope.
    ```
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
        i;
    }
    i;     // i is still declared outside the loop, and with value 10
    ```
- Pay particular attention to the example at the top of page 54.
- Make a point to **always declare variables at the top of functions/files**.
- Here is an example of what can go horribly wrong if you are not careful: [local_global.html](../testPages/local_global.html) and [local_global.js](../testPages/local_global.js)

    > Note: Files loaded via `<script>` tags all share the same global space. Whatever you do in one file can impact the other files.
